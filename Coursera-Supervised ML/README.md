# Supervised Machine Learning: Regession and Classification

---

## Week1

Machine learning algorithms:

* Supervised learning:

    * Regession
    * Classification

* Unsupervised learning:

    * Clustering: group similar data points together
    * Anomaly detection: Find unusual data
    * Dimentionality reduction: Compress data
    
* Semisupervised learning
* Reinforce learning
